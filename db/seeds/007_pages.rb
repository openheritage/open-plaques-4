The data and resources generated by the project are free to use under a Public Domain declaration.\r\n\r\nAs well as showing&nbsp;[where they are](/places/), we identify&nbsp;[who is commemorated](/people/) on them,&nbsp;[what those people are notable for](/roles/a-z/a) and what their connection is with the place where their plaque is installed. We uncover this data through a process of painstaking research by our team of volunteer co-curators (if you spot a mistake, tell us).\r\n\r\n## Press Enquiries\r\nWe are always happy to chat about plaques and have been featured in Gizmodo, Guardian Tech, Radio 4, Sunday Times Property, BBC's Mark Forrest Radio Programme, and a BBC News web site article.\r\n\r\n## Are you from a plaque organisation?\r\nWe have gathered the data from many organisations which have established and maintain plaque schemes globally. As the plaques by their very nature are public information, we are keen for more&nbsp;[organisations](http://openplaques.org/organisations) to share their data so it can be included, forming a complete database and a unified map of the plaques' locations. Please &nbsp;[get in touch](http://openplaques.org/contact)&nbsp; if you'd like your plaques to be included.\r\n\r\n## How can you add plaques and photos?\r\nIndividuals can&nbsp;[add plaque listings and information](/contribute) directly to the site, and add photos to the listings via Flickr, Geograph, Wikimedia Commons, or by&nbsp;[emailing](/contact) them to us. Follow a \"Your photo. How to add it\" link on any plaque for more details.\r\n\r\nThe service and the data are in constant development. If you know of any plaques not listed in our database (try&nbsp;[searching](/search) the site first), we love to hear about them, or better still make your mark and&nbsp;[add them to the website](/contribute)!\r\n\r\n## What kind of plaques can be contributed?\r\nA plaque is a sign that connects people or events to a  specific location sometime in the past. We also feature plaques that commemorate notable buildings due to their historic nature or the architect who designed them.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of collecting the plaques is to uncover the direct history of places. General plaques not denoting anything specific from history, and also memorial plaques to people or events that have no connection to the *immediate* vicinity of the plaque fall outside our remit. Plaques erected primarily to denote the opening of buildings and businesses or awards given to buildings are also beyond the scope of the service, as are ones solely noting a burial site or grave.\r\n\r\nIf you are unsure if a plaque meets the criteria of Open Plaques just&nbsp;[email us](/contact) the text of the plaque inscription or a copy of any photo you have, or send us a link to the photo if you have already published it online, and we'll let you know.\r\n\r\n## Royal Society of the Arts Catalyst Fund support\r\n\r\nIn 2010 Open Plaques received a&nbsp;[Catalyst Fund](http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/catalyst-fund) seed funding grant from the [RSA](http://www.thersa.org/) to run an event which would further the development of our website as an open source community that supports education and learning purposes.

Check your local area to see whether the local council or civic society has an active plaque program and approach them with your nomination. Alternatively, there may be a national society that might be interested. Or you can go it alone. Many people have. \r\n\r\nWe have a short list of suppliers that we can recommend if you contact us. If you do go ahead please say that we sent you as one day we might want to make one ourselves.")

We exclude foundation stones, grave markers, and memorials. There are always exceptions, so if in doubt send us an email and discuss it. \r\n\r\nWhat can you do to help? You could...\r\n\r\n<h2>Add a plaque</h2>\r\nAnyone who has found a plaque in real life or on the internet that is not already in our database can&nbsp;<b><a href=\"/plaques/new\">add it</a></b>.

We like close-ups and also long-shots of the building that set the scene.\r\nWe deliberately do not ask you to upload photos to our site. We connect and add context to existing resources on the web instead of trying to own it all ourselves.\r\nThe photos that we show are published with a Creative Commons licence on web sites such as Flickr, Wikimedia and Geograph.\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute your own photograph please click on the 'Your photo how to add it' link on the plaque page.\r\n\r\n<h2>Inform us of an error, omission or quirk</h2>\r\nWe take information and enhance it by researching on the web, talking to people, and linking to photographs.\r\n  \r\n<h2>Tell us about your plaques</h2>\r\nIf you are a civic society, council, history group, or any of the hundreds of organisations who have erected plaques please get in <a href=\"/contact\">contact</a> and we can add details of your plaques. We will accept a list in any form, just so long as it contains who the plaque is about and a postal address. Additional information like the full inscription and geolocation are ideal but not essential.\r\n  \r\n<h2>Talk to us</h2>\r\nThings do not always work; there are many edge cases for whether a plaque should be included; you have something interesting to tell us; or the system is just too confusing.

However, you are under no obligation to do so.\r\n\r\n<h2>Become a curator</h2>\r\nOur band of curators have additional powers to curate Open Plaques' data.
